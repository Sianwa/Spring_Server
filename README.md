# Spring Websocket Server 
Created a Spring Websocket Server to communicate with our Android client.

## How it works
The application is ment to simulate Add to Cart functionality over websocket communication.
The android client sends the item id to the server and the server returns the cost of the item and its then dislayed on the client interface.
